  content: "Hey Mark, you know how we\u2019re always taste-testing new candy flavors?
    Well, I think I\u2019ve found the ultimate winner \u2013 a marshall-mellow (get
    it??)- peanut butter swirl that\u2019s out of this world! You have to try it!!
    I left a few samples on your desk, let me know what you think. And don\u2019t
    worry, I won\u2019t tell anyone if you sneak a few more ;-) Best, Lila"
