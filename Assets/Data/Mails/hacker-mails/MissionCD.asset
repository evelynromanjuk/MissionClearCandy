  content: Good evening, hereby I am sending you the mission details.\nWe were informed
    that Wunka Sweet Industries is working on a potentially dangerous substance that
    is supposed to be included in their upcoming candy line. We want you to get more
    information on this substance. As far as we know, it is possible to create and
    analyze the substance with the machines of the laboratory. Do that and get us
    the card on which all data is saved.\n\nGood luck.
